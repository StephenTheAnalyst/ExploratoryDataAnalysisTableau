# Exploratory Data Analysis Tableau

## Project Overview

**This project aims to shade light on the sales of bike in a bike store around 3 regions (Pacific, Europe, North America).** 

## Data Overview

**This [dataset](https://github.com/StephenTheAnalyst/ExploratoryDataAnalysisTableau/blob/main/Excel%20Project%20Dataset.xlsx) contains the sales of bikes in 3 regions. The dataset contains 13 columns, which are:**

## Tools

 - Tableau

## Data Cleaning/Preparation

 - I created some sets : When i was working this dataset in excel, i had to use the if statement to group the ages into groups, it was quite easier here, i just had to create a set. I also created set on marital status and purchased bike columns.

 ## Exploratory Data Analysis

  1. What role does Age play in the purchase of bikes?

## We can tell from the visualization that customers that purchased bike over the age of 50 were very low. Also notice how the sales peaked between the age 35 and 50. 

  2. How did the number of children customers have affect the sales of bike?

## It is evidential that the more the kids have, the lesser the purchase of bike.

  3. How does the distance to customer's place of work affect the purchase of bike?

## The visualization shows that the distance to customer's place of work affects the purchase of bike. We can see that the farther the work place, the lesser they bought bike.

  4. How does the customer's income affects the purchase of bike?
